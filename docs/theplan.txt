TOBIAS THE BOT DESIGN PLAN

Bot runs a xmpp client
Settings like username and password are read from a settings file.
1 When it recieves a new message:
	Check if it's part of a previous command (value stored on redis for 120 seconds)
	Else check if there's any file on commands directory corresponding to the first word of the command
	
	A command can be a node.js script or any command that outputs to stdout
	Send text back to user
																	
2 Bot also sends automated messages at specified times
  Also read from a directory???
